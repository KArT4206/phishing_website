# Phishing Website Setup
A tool for simulating phishing attacks, designed to help cybersecurity professionals and enthusiasts understand phishing techniques in a controlled and ethical environment.

## Features

- Clone and set up the phishing website on a local machine
- Choose from various phishing pages to simulate
- Capture login information from simulated phishing websites
- Educational and testing purposes only
- Easy-to-follow script for setup and use

## Technologies Used

- Language: Bash  
- Input Format: Manual input via script  
- Simulation Type: Terminal-based

## Algorithmic Strategy

This project simulates phishing attacks through a straightforward script that sets up a fake website and captures user input.

- The script allows users to choose between different phishing page templates.
- Once set up, the script simulates a phishing attack by mimicking a login page, collecting user data for analysis.

## How to Clone and Run

### 1. Clone the repository:

Open a terminal and clone the repository by running:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/KArT4206/phishing.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd phishing
```

### 3. Run the phishing script:

Execute the script by running:

```bash
bash phisher.sh
```

This script will guide you through setting up the phishing website.

## HTML Code (Raveena and Padmasree)

The HTML code for the phishing pages (e.g., login pages, etc.) can be found in the **[phishing_website](https://github.com/KArT4206/phishing_website.git)** repository.

To clone the repository with the HTML files, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KArT4206/phishing_website.git
```

These HTML templates are designed to mimic popular websites and gather login information. You can customize them for different scenarios.

## Usage

1. After running the script, you'll be prompted to choose the phishing page you want to simulate.
2. The script will automatically configure the fake website on your system.
3. Once set up, the fake website will collect user data, which can then be analyzed for security testing.
